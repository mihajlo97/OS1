An integral part of every kernel is the multithreading module. This module implements multithreading using timesharing.
The module also includes preemption using interrupt routines coming in from hardware generated interrupts such as the keyboard, as well as a semaphore based synchronization mechanism between threads.
This module is programmed for the Intel 8086 processor using C++98 and the BCC compiler.
